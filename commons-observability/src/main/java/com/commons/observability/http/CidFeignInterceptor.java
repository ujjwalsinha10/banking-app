/**
 * 📡 CidFeignInterceptor
 *
 * This interceptor ensures that every outbound Feign HTTP request carries a
 * `X-Request-Id` header — which represents the **correlation ID (cid)**.
 *
 * ✅ Purpose:
 * - Enable **end-to-end request traceability** across distributed microservices.
 * - Ensure downstream services log the same `cid` so logs can be correlated.
 *
 * 🧠 How it works:
 * - Attempts to read the existing correlation ID from the SLF4J MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context).
 * - If no `cid` is present (e.g., first hop or missing in context), generates a new UUID.
 * - Adds this `cid` as an `X-Request-Id` header to the outgoing Feign request.
 *
 * ⚙️ This class is automatically picked up and registered as a `RequestInterceptor`
 *     when enabled by `commons.logging.feign.enabled=true` in the auto-configuration.
